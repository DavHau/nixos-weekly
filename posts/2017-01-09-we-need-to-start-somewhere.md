# We need to start somewhere - #1

As NixOS is growing in popularity so is the community. It is harder and harder
to be updated on all the interesting bits that are happening on all the corners
of our community. And this is the reason for starting NixOS weekly.

Welcome to the first edition of NixOS weekly news. We hope that you will like
it, if not let us know how we can do it better.

As we try to figure out the right format here are our current ideas:

- We are not sure that there is enough happening every week, so we will post
  this newsletter every second week. Eventually this will become a more

- All collaborations happens on [github][XX] and posts are written in markdown
  format. We need to get this to be community driven.

- Being on time is more important then trying to write about everything that
  happened.
