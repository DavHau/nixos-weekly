:description: ... when it is time for them to die and are reborn from the
              ashes. (J.K. Rowling, Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets)

The phoenix is a long-lived fiery bird that is present in many different
mythologies from around the world. When a phoenix “dies”, it does so by
combustion and is reborn of the ashes left behind. It rises from its own ashes,
in the freshness of youth, to live through another cycle of years. So in
a sense, it never truly dies, but regenerates itself and lives forever. Just
like this weekly newsletter.

Welcome to the 2018 NixOS weekly newsletter. We are back and hope to produce
more of them this year then we did last year. As always contributions are more
then welcome. The more people help shape this newsletter the more accurate it
will be.
