Some fun stats:

- ~ 900 new packages since 16.09
- ~ 80 new contributors (very inexact science this)
- ~ 60 new services

Reading
=======

- One long-standing issue in Nix has been the storage of secrets. Right now `many of our services`_ store their secrets in ``/nix`` where they are world readable. This means you can't have root-only secrets, multi-user systems are problematic, and if one of your services is compromised it can be used to steal all your other secrets. Eelco created an RFC for `encrypting secrets at rest`_.
