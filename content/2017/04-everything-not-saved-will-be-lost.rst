:description: Everything not saved will be lost. (Nintendo Quit Screen message)

Nix, NixOS and nixpkgs are all moving ahead at good speed. The `17.03
milestone`_ is more than 50% complete, and we merged 144 pull requests for
nixpkgs just in the last seven days.

News
====

- The `NixOS 17.03 beta
  <http://lists.science.uu.nl/pipermail/nix-dev/2017-March/022979.html>`__ has
  been announced.

- We now allow packages to be marked insecure, and you have to opt-in to install
  insecure packages similarly to how you opt in to non-free software. The option
  is called ``permittedInsecurePackages``. See the `updated docs`_ for more.

- Robin finished the `systemd 232 update`_ which opens up several new
  `opportunities for hardening`_. It will also allow us to move away from
  hard-coded user IDs for less important services. Just use ``DynamicUser =
  true``.

- Thanks to Graham we now have `aarch64 support`_, and it's even being built by
  Hydra! Many of you will have noticed already from the beautiful stream of
  emails for each succeeding and failing package.

- Progress on the `proposal for RFC <https://github.com/zimbatm/rfcs/pull/1>`__
  which started from a FOSDEM discussion.

- `Move NodeJS to separate overlay repository?
  <http://lists.science.uu.nl/pipermail/nix-dev/2017-March/023043.html>`__
