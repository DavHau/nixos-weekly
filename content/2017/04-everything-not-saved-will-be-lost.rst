:description: Everything not saved will be lost. (Nintendo Quit Screen message)

Nix, NixOS and nixpkgs are all moving ahead at good speed. The `17.03 milestone`_ is more than 50% complete, and we merged 144 pull requests for nixpkgs just in the last seven days.

News
====

- We now allow packages to be marked insecure, and you have to opt-in to install insecure packages similarly to how you opt in to non-free software.  The option is called ``permittedInsecurePackages``. See the `updated docs`_ for more.

- Robin finished the `systemd 232 update`_ which opens up several new `opportunities for hardening`_. It will also allow us to move away from hard-coded user IDs for less important services. Just use ``DynamicUser = true``.

- Thanks to Graham we now have `aarch64 support`_, and it's even being build Hydra! Many of you will have noticed already from the beatiful stream of emails for each succeeding and failing package.

TODO

- `Smarkets`_, London, United Kingdom

  We are looking for  `Infra team lead`_ and `Infra engineer`_.

  The jobs are not a Nix jobs per se since we are not using Nix at the moment.
  However, internally few of us are interested in trying it for e.g. building
  AMIs or provisioning docker containers with (mostly) python software. We think
  some strong candidate with experience of using Nix in production would have
  a good chance of seeing some adoption here.
