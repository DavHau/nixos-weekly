  the `Wikis <https://github.com/nixos-users/wiki/wiki>`_!


  `This <https://github.com/NixOS/nixos-org-configurations/pull/30>`_

  migrating the content.

  Current options are the `Community Cookbook
  <https://nix-cookbook.readthedocs.io/en/latest/index.html>`_ and the
  `nixos-users Wiki <https://github.com/nixos-users/wiki/wiki>`_. The
  latter is editable by anyone with a GitHub account.
