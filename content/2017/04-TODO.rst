  fits together, there will be people available to help you.

- **Feb 24â€“26, 2017**, `HackIllinois`_, University of Illinois, USA

  For any university students in the US, the University of Illinois at
  Urbana-Champaign is holding a hackathon oriented towards getting people into
  open source development, and I'm going to be mentoring people for
  Nix/NixOS/Haskell development. Be sure to put "NixOS" or "Haskell" into your
  application somewhere.

- `Smarkets`_, London, United Kingdom

  We are looking for  `Infra team lead`_ and `Infra engineer`_.

  The jobs are not a Nix jobs per se since we are not using Nix at the moment.
  However, internally few of us are interested in trying it for e.g. building
  AMIs or provisioning docker containers with (mostly) python software. We think
  some strong candidate with experience of using Nix in production would have
  a good chance of seeing some adoption here.
