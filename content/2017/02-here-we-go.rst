- **Feb 09, 2017**, `NixOS: Functional Packaging For The Win`_ by
  `Tobias Pflug`_ at `Wasserturm Stromeyersdorf`_, Konstanz, Germany

  Some of you might have heard about NixOS and its very different approach to a
  package and configuration management. While I am certainly not an expert
  with Nix myself I did tinker with it for a bit and I think it's awesome.
  I would like to give you an idea of the concepts, possibilities and maybe
  spark some interest.

- **Feb 24–26, 2017**, `HackIllinois`_, University of Illinois, USA

  For any university students in the US, the University of Illinois at

  open source development, and I'm going to be mentoring people for
  Nix/NixOS/Haskell development. Be sure to put "NixOS" or "Haskell" into your
  application somewhere.

Jobs
====

- `Smarkets`_, London, United Kingdom

  We are looking for  `Infra team lead`_ and `Infra engineer`_.

  The jobs are not a Nix jobs per se since we are not using Nix at the moment.
  However, internally few of us are interested in trying it for e.g. building
  AMIs or provisioning docker containers with (mostly) python software. We think
  some strong candidate with experience of using Nix in production would have
  a good chance of seeing some adoption here.

Editor's corner
===============

Lately, I was thinking about the structure of this newsletter and noticed that
it is quite **advance Nix** oriented. Would a section where we would
**promote** questions from reddit / stack overflow be of any help to newcomers?
