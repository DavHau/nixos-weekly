# News

- [nix is now easier to bootstrap](https://github.com/NixOS/nix/pull/2979) on Linux distributions without previous nix installation.

  Non-NixOS users are encouraged to try and report whether the improved autoconf checks make it easier to build it from source.
- [`static-haskell-nix` started a crowd-funding](https://github.com/NixOS/nixpkgs/issues/43795#issuecomment-503048915) on [OpenCollective](https://opencollective.com/static-haskell-nix) during [ZuriHac](https://zfoh.ch/zurihac2019/) to get its own dedicated Hetzner build server. Amazingly, the funding goal was reached [within only 4 days](https://github.com/NixOS/nixpkgs/issues/43795#issuecomment-504266116)!
- A big rework of the `gstreamer` package was landed in nixpkgs with the [upgrade to 1.16](https://github.com/NixOS/nixpkgs/pull/54398).

  It also demonstrates how `meson`-build-system-based projects can be configured to complain loudly about any missing dependencies, as opposed to silently disabling features (like many `autoconf` based build systems do).
