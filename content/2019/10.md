- [A set of patches to build Redox on NixOS](https://gitlab.redox-os.org/redox-os/redox-nix)

  An attempt to embrace Nix instead of constantly working around the
  limitations to build Redox OS. The ultra optimistic long-term goal
  is to be a competing alternative to the GNU make build system the
  project currently uses, to make Redox builds reproducible and
  reliable.
