- [Improved performance in Nixpkgs](https://matthewbauer.us/blog/avoid-subshells.html)

  Improving Nixpkgs setup by avoiding subshells in processing dependencies.

- [Recently rewritten Nix-on-Droid](https://github.com/t184256/nix-on-droid-bootstrap)
  got [accepted into F-Droid repository](https://f-droid.org/en/packages/com.termux.nix)

  Trying out Nix on your aarch64 or i686 Android device is now easier than ever.

- Two big stdenv cleanups [Enable `__structuredAttrs`](https://github.com/NixOS/nixpkgs/pull/72074) and [treewide: `set -u` everywhere](https://github.com/NixOS/nixpkgs/pull/72347)

  It's time to clean up stdenv!
  By making our code less fragile, we increase the budget for interesting features. 
  There should be plenty of failures, but many of them independent so we can easily parallelize the work to fix.
  Please come pitch in!
